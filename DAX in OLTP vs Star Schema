DAX in OLTP vs Star Schema, a real-life usecase
Lot has been posted stating that DAX becomes complex if the dataset is not in star schema aka data warehouse. I could not come across any satisfying representation substantiating this aspect. All the examples were revolving around converting date into date hierarchy in a fact table whereas this is not the real use case. 
In this post I have shown how a sales transaction is recorded in an OLTP system and a DAX for calculating SALES is shown below it. In contrast I have shown how DAX becomes simple if the data is dimensioned as per star schema
