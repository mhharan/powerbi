DAX in OLTP vs Star Schema, a real-life usecase
Lot has been posted stating that DAX becomes complex if the dataset is not in star schema aka data warehouse. I could not come across any satisfying representation substantiating this aspect. All the examples were revolving around converting date into date hierarchy in a fact table whereas this is not the real use case. 
In this post I have shown how a sales transaction is recorded in an OLTP system and a DAX for calculating SALES is shown below it. In contrast I have shown how DAX becomes simple if the data is dimensioned as per star schema


What would you prefer - 6 Line complex DAX code or 1 Line simple DAX code

In this post I have shown how a sales transaction is recorded in an OLTP system and a DAX for calculating SALES. You will need a write a 6 line complex DAX code, if your data is not modelled around Star Schema, where as a Star Schema data model makes the DAX code simple and easy to write.

Would love to know about challenges you faced while modelling your data from OLTP to Star Schema.
