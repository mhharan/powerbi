What would you prefer - 6 Line complex DAX code or 1 Line simple DAX code 
In this post, I have shown how a sales transaction is recorded in an OLTP system and a DAX for calculating SALES. You will need a write a 6 line complex DAX code if your data is not modeled around Star Schema, whereas a Star Schema data model makes the DAX code simple and easy to write. 
I would love to know about your challenges while modeling your data from OLTP to Star Schema.
