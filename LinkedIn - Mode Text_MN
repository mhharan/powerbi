Why mode a right measure to calculate the average than median (depends on your data).
In statistics, the mean, median, and mode are the three common measure of central tendency. Choosing the best measure of central tendency depends on the type of data you have. 
In this context, I choose to use hospital billing system datasets, if we take the average billing per patient for a hospital, my first impression would be £35,000, very simple as it taking the average of total patient billing, but if you deep dive into the amount column. You would notice the value got distorted beacuse of few high peaks. Whereas if used Mode instead of Average, then the correct average per patient billing would be £4000 (in my opinion i.e. the most commonly occurring amount). I've attached the pbix file with my calculation to show you all how to calculate them, and how to determine which one is best for your data, please play around with the datasets, give a try and let me know your thoughts.
